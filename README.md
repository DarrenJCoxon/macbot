# Macbot: AI Shakespeare Companion üé≠üìö

Macbot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to help students explore and understand Shakespeare's tragedy, Macbeth. Leveraging advanced AI technologies, Macbot provides insightful analysis, contextual understanding, and interactive learning.

## üåü Features

- AI-powered chat interface for Macbeth analysis
- Document upload functionality (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .md) for custom context
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using uploaded documents for precise responses
- Shakespearean-themed user interface
- Admin section for uploading and managing knowledge base documents

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before deployment, you'll need to obtain API keys from:
1. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) (for LLM access - supports various models)
2. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) (for text embeddings)
3. [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) (for vector database)

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- Next.js 14+ (or your current version)
- React
- TypeScript
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) LLM (Configured for Grok-3-Mini by default, adaptable)
- OpenAI Embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`)
- Pinecone Vector Database (Serverless)
- Styled-Components (for theming)
- `pdfreader` (for server-side PDF text extraction)
- `mammoth` (for server-side DOCX text extraction)

## üîß Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/macbot.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd macbot

2. Install Dependencies

This command installs all necessary packages, including Next.js, React, Pinecone client, OpenAI client, OpenRouter requirements (via fetch), pdfreader, mammoth, etc., as defined in package.json.

npm install
# or
yarn install
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in the project root with the following variables:

# OpenRouter API Key (for LLM)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key

# Optional but RECOMMENDED: Required by OpenRouter API TOS - Your app's public URL
# Use http://localhost:3000 for local dev, replace with deployed URL in production
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Your app's name for OpenRouter headers
OPENROUTER_SITE_NAME="MacBot Development"

# OpenAI API Key (for embeddings)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Pinecone Configuration
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
PINECONE_INDEX=your_pinecone_index_name # e.g., "macbot-index"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Env
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Get your keys from the respective service websites.

Choose a unique name for your PINECONE_INDEX.

OPENROUTER_SITE_URL should be the URL where your app is accessible (even localhost during development).

4. Run the Development Server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Access the admin section at http://localhost:3000/admin.

üåç Deployment
Vercel (Recommended)

![alt text](https://vercel.com/button)

Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.

Configure the Environment Variables in your Vercel project settings (using the same names as in .env.local). Remember to set OPENROUTER_SITE_URL to your actual Vercel deployment URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.vercel.app).

Deploy! Vercel will automatically build and deploy your Next.js app.

Alternative Platforms

Netlify

Render

AWS Amplify

DigitalOcean App Platform

Ensure you set the same environment variables required in .env.local on your chosen platform. You might need to configure build settings specific to the platform.

üîç Usage Tips

Go to the /admin page (The Scribe's Chambers) to upload documents (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .md) into the knowledge base using the "Upload Documents" section.

Use the "Uploaded Documents" section on the admin page to view indexed files and delete them from the Pinecone knowledge base if needed.

Return to the main page ("Return to the Oracle") to chat.

Ask specific questions about Macbeth. The AI will use the general model knowledge and retrieve relevant information from your uploaded documents via RAG.

Explore themes, characters, and literary devices.

üéì Disclaimer

Macbot is an educational tool and should be used as a supplement to reading and studying the original text. AI responses, especially those based on RAG, are dependent on the quality and content of the uploaded documents.
